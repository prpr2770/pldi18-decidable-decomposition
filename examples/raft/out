Isolate node_term:

    The following properties are assumed as axioms:
        natural_numbers.ivy: line 20: term.spec.prop217
        natural_numbers.ivy: term.spec.prop218
        natural_numbers.ivy: line 22: term.spec.prop219

        /home/ivyuser/ivy/ivy/include/1.7/order.ivy: line 6: term.spec.totality

    The inductive invariant consists of the following conjectures:

        raft.ivy: line 499: node_term.invar307
        raft.ivy: line 501: node_term.invar308

    The following action implementations are present:
        raft.ivy: line 491: implementation of node_term.empty
        raft.ivy: line 483: implementation of node_term.get
        raft.ivy: line 485: implementation of node_term.set

    The following action monitors are present:
        raft.ivy: line 532: monitor of node_term.empty
        raft.ivy: line 507: monitor of node_term.get
        raft.ivy: line 504: monitor of node_term.get
        raft.ivy: line 512: monitor of node_term.set

    The following initializers are present:
        raft.ivy: line 545: node_term.init_promises.init[after315]

    Initialization must establish the invariant

    The following set of external actions must preserve the invariant:

    The following program assertions are treated as assumptions:
        in action node_term.get when called from the environment:
            raft.ivy: line 505: assumption

    The following program assertions are treated as guarantees:
